The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

one ) Beautiful is better than ugly.
two ) Explicit is better than implicit.
three ) Simple is better than complex.
four ) Complex is better than complicated.
five ) Flat is better than nested.
six ) Sparse is better than dense.
seven ) Readability counts.
eight ) Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
nine ) Although practicality beats purity.
ten ) Errors should never pass silently.
eleven ) Unless explicitly silenced.
twelve ) In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
thirteen ) There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
fourteen ) Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
fifteen ) Now is better than never.
sixteen ) Although never is often better than *right* now.
seventeen ) If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
eighteen ) If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
nineteen ) Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
